## FAQ

### How can I edit the CSS?

The CSS is located in [./src/styles/style.scss](./src/styles/style.scss) and you can edit it there. At the bottom you will see all the styles specific for the dark version.

### How can I change the Prism theme?

I import the prism theme in [./src/pages/index.js](./src/pages/index.js) and in there you can use any theme or make your own and use it by importing. I made a tool you can see [here](http://prism.dotenv.dev/) that helps you make your VSCode theme into a prism theme easily.

### The chapters are screwed up in my version

I use a really HUUUUGE hack to get them, I go through every H1 created by the markdown file and make that into a chapter so I can only recognize H1's as chapters at least until I find a better way :(
If you want to try and fix that the code is at [./generate-book/epub.js](./generate-book/epub.js).

## Why?

I built this in order to be able to publish a book I wrote and I think it may be useful for someone so I made it open source.

## Books using this:

Let me know if you are using this to make your book :)
