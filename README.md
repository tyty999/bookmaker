6. Profit??

## Why?

I built this in order to be able to publish a book I wrote and I think it may be useful for someone so I made it OSS.

## Where can I edit the syntax highlight theme?

You can change it in the [`pages/index.js`](https://github.com/SaraVieira/gatsby-starter-book/blob/master/src/pages/index.js#L15)

## Why not a theme?

I want you to be able to edit everything as it will be your book so I think this workflow makes sense
